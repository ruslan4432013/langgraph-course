A neural network (also called an artificial neural network, ANN, or simply a neural network) is a mathematical model, as well as its software or hardware implementation, built on the principle of organizing neural networks (biological neural networks) — networks of nerve cells (neurons) of a living organism. This concept arose when studying the processes occurring in the brain and when trying to model these processes. The first such attempt was the neural networks of W. McCulloch and W. Pitts in 1943.After the development of learning algorithms, the resulting models began to be used for practical purposes: in forecasting tasks, for pattern recognition, in control tasks, etc. From the point of view of computer technology and programming development, a neural network is a way to solve the problem of effective parallelism. Neural networks are not programmed in the usual sense of the word, they are trained.
